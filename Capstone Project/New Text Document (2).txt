Profit Percentage = 
DIVIDE([Profit], [Revenue], 0) * 100

Certainly! Here are some additional useful measures for analyzing the sales data:

### 1. **Total Discount Amount**
   This measure calculates the total discount given on all sales.

   ```DAX
   Total Discount = 
   SUMX(
       'Sales',
       'Sales'[Order Quantity] * 'Sales'[Unit Price] * ('Sales'[Unit Price Discount Pct] / 100)
   )
   ```

### 2. **Average Order Value**
   This measure calculates the average revenue per order, which helps in understanding customer purchasing behavior.

   ```DAX
   Average Order Value = 
   DIVIDE([Revenue], COUNTROWS('Sales'), 0)
   ```

### 3. **Gross Margin Percentage**
   This measure indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold, often used to assess profitability.

   ```DAX
   Gross Margin Percentage = 
   DIVIDE([Profit], [Revenue], 0) * 100
   ```

### 4. **Total Units Sold**
   This measure calculates the total number of units sold across all orders.

   ```DAX
   Total Units Sold = 
   SUM('Sales'[Order Quantity])
   ```

### 5. **Average Discount Percentage**
   This measure shows the average discount percentage applied across all sales, which can be useful for analyzing pricing strategies.

   ```DAX
   Average Discount Percentage = 
   AVERAGE('Sales'[Unit Price Discount Pct])
   ```

### 6. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
   This measure calculates the total cost of goods sold based on the standard cost and quantity sold.

   ```DAX
   COGS = 
   SUMX(
       'Sales',
       'Sales'[Order Quantity] * 'Sales'[Product Standard Cost]
   )
   ```

### 7. **Order Count**
   This measure counts the total number of unique sales orders, which can be useful for understanding order volume.

   ```DAX
   Order Count = 
   DISTINCTCOUNT('Sales'[SalesOrderLineKey])
   ```

### 8. **Sales Growth Percentage**
   This measure calculates the percentage growth in sales compared to the previous period, providing insights into trends.

   ```DAX
   Sales Growth Percentage = 
   DIVIDE(
       [Revenue] - CALCULATE([Revenue], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)),
       CALCULATE([Revenue], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR)),
       0
   ) * 100
   ```

### 9. **Top Product Revenue Contribution**
   This measure calculates the revenue contribution of the top product by sales to the total revenue.

   ```DAX
   Top Product Revenue Contribution = 
   DIVIDE(
       CALCULATE([Revenue], 
                 'Sales'[ProductKey] = 
                 TOPN(1, 'Sales', [Revenue], DESC)
                ),
       [Revenue], 0
   ) * 100
   ```

### 10. **Average Selling Price per Unit**
   This measure calculates the average selling price for each unit sold.

   ```DAX
   Average Selling Price = 
   DIVIDE([Revenue], [Total Units Sold], 0)
   ```

These measures provide deeper insights into your data, such as profit margins, order behavior, sales growth, and product performance. You can use these measures in visualizations and dashboards to enhance data analysis in Power BI.

To meet the CEO's requirements effectively, here are some Power BI visualizations you can use:

### 1. **Map Visual**
- **Purpose**: Display profit/loss by country with tooltips for detailed insights.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Use a **Filled Map** or **Shape Map** to visualize the countries.
  - Set the **Location** to the country field and the **Values** to the profit/loss measure.
  - Customize the tooltip to show profit development over time (e.g., a line chart showing profit trends).

### 2. **Line Chart**
- **Purpose**: Show overall revenue development over time.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a **Line Chart** with time on the X-axis (e.g., months or quarters) and total revenue on the Y-axis.
  - You can add a trend line to highlight overall revenue trends.

### 3. **Matrix Visual**
- **Purpose**: Analyze profit across categories and subcategories.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a **Matrix** visual where rows represent categories and subcategories, and columns represent profit.
  - Use **conditional formatting** (like data bars) to visually emphasize profit levels. Set thresholds to distinguish between high and low profits.

### 4. **Bar/Column Chart**
- **Purpose**: Compare profit across categories or countries.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a **Clustered Bar Chart** or **Column Chart** to visualize profit by category or country.
  - This can complement the matrix visual, providing a quick comparison.

### 5. **Tooltip Page**
- **Purpose**: Enhance user experience by showing additional data on hover.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a dedicated tooltip page that includes visuals such as line charts (for profit development), bar charts, or cards (showing key metrics).
  - Set this page as a tooltip for the map visual and other relevant visuals.

### Summary of Visuals:
- **Filled Map**: To visualize profit/loss by country with tooltips.
- **Line Chart**: For overall revenue development over time.
- **Matrix Visual**: To display profit by categories and subcategories with conditional formatting.
- **Clustered Bar/Column Chart**: For comparing profits easily.
- **Tooltip Page**: For enriched hover-over insights.

These visuals will provide a comprehensive dashboard that meets the CEO’s requirements for profit insights, revenue trends, and detailed category analysis.
